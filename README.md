# Autocomplete Home Task

## Steps to Run

### Pull code down to local.

### Run `yarn install` or `npm install`

This will depend on prefence, however, this assures that your machine is running the same version of react, node and typescript as mine.

### Then run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Then run `yarn run start` or `npm start`

The application should now be available on your local host at port 3000.

### Finish time and final notes.

I am finishing this portion of the task at around 1 hour and 45 minutes. I began at 12:12 and am finished now at 1:57. 

This could be extended to autocomplete word by word after spaces, for the purpose of the task I held it to just one word as though it were a form for entering country of origin.
